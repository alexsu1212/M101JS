I did the whole, they deliver the boxes to you and you set them, then you drop them off at the end deal because it was cheaper. Set them up fine, dealt with mediocre service (even though I was paying for the fastest speeds they offered) for the spring, and then packed them up and forgot to return them to my local Comcast office when I drove home to Chicago.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So when I realized I hadn&amp;#39;t returned them I brought them to my local Comcast branch, and made sure they knew that these boxes were from my account in Massachusetts, and turned them in and was told my account was &amp;quot;all clear.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Comes the first week of June, I get a bill, for June. I call up Comcast, they say my account is still active. I tell them it isn&amp;#39;t, that I hadn&amp;#39;t had my boxes in 2 weeks, and that I had returned them. Comcast disconnects my service.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Third week of June. Get a call from a Comcast rep asking me for the boxes, I say I returned them, he asks for a receipt. In the midst of unpacking I hadn&amp;#39;t saved it (my biggest fuck-up of the summer unfortunately), and I told the rep this, along with the exact address of where I had returned it along with the approximate time, exact date, and which windowed teller I had approached to return it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Second week of July. Start receiving calls daily from Comcast, that are everything from softly-worded &amp;quot;Please return our boxes&amp;quot; to threats a-la &amp;quot;If you don&amp;#39;t return our boxes we will fine your account X, Y, or Z&amp;quot; to them all I reply the same way, &amp;quot;I returned the boxes on 5/X/2014, at this address in Chicago. I don&amp;#39;t have the receipt sorry, it was over 2 months ago and I was in the middle of a move&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Late July, like the last few days of the last week, I finally talk to someone that sounds managerial in tone. We have a long conversation, and at the end of it she says, &amp;quot;Okay, I&amp;#39;m going to chalk this up to us losing the boxes in our system, and I am going to mark your account as cleared and closed.&amp;quot; I even asked her, &amp;quot;So this is the last I&amp;#39;ll be hearing about it? I just want this to end, it&amp;#39;s quite a bother&amp;quot; to which she replied, &amp;quot;yes, just try to remember the receipt next time&amp;quot; I laughed, she laughed, I hung up and felt good about the situation.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Everything was quiet until today.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A few minutes ago, I received a call from someone who was clearly reading off a script and not very good at reading English. They told me, through the terrible call quality, that they were calling from some collection agency (Couldn&amp;#39;t make out the name), but at first they tried to sound government-related. Then he tells me the call may be recorded so that it can be used as evidence in a court proceeding. So I naturally became nervous and asked what it was about, since I know I don&amp;#39;t owe the government any money for like taxes or whatever. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The guy said it was in regards to me owing $57 to Comcast (this is the lowest amount of money they have asked for so far, at first they were coming in with numbers around $80-100, though I never paid specific attention since I know I owe them $0).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I asked them what it was in regards to, &lt;em&gt;specifically&lt;/em&gt;, and the guy just said, &amp;quot;A charge on your account&amp;quot; I said &amp;quot;My account is closed&amp;quot; to which he replied, &amp;quot;Your account was closed and it&amp;#39;s last statement is from May&amp;quot; this is true. He then continued, &amp;quot;This is a charge that was left unpaid on the account at the time it was closed&amp;quot; which makes no sense, why would they let me close my account with an outstanding charge on it?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Ultimately it is pretty clear to me that Comcast is just lowering the amount they are asking for and asking for it in increasingly seemingly-serious ways to...I don&amp;#39;t know, scare me into paying them $57? It&amp;#39;s ridiculous and if it comes down to them taking me to court I suppose I&amp;#39;ll end up paying it, however if/when that occurs they will surely have spent more $$$ in labor hours talking-to/threatening me on the phone than the money will be worth.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I just wanted to vent. I recognize that ultimately, without a receipt and with Comcast either not keeping records of the transaction or choosing to ignore their records that verify my account of things, I don&amp;#39;t have a real leg to stand on. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So I guess this is part story, part PSA about how whenever you deal with powerful entities, whether it be an overarmed, under-trained police officer or an over-enabled, under-regulated corporation, record anything and everything, be it audio, video, or documentary. You never know when down the line the other party will decide to rewrite the past to serve their present and at that point any recordings they have made will only be used if they can hurt you, they&amp;#39;re never going to go to them in search of what actually happened.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Thanks, and have a nice day&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "selftext": "Hello everyone.\n   \nMostly this is to vent, because right now I am a mixture of furious and annoyed.\n   \nSo, I was living Massachusetts over the spring, and I had comcast because my options were Comcast and Fuck Off.
